[0018] I Feel Cheated and Conned/Dr. Robert Wallace/20170413

Dear Wallace: I am a 19-year-old guy who purchased my first automobile. I had been driving my mother's car. Since I have employment I have to pay for my own car insurance. When I got my policy, I was shocked at the cost. I'm too young to drink and I don't do drugs. I'm also a very careful driver who has never been in an accident or even had a traffic ticket. I don't wear glasses and I'm a former high school athlete and have excellent reflexes.

I feel ripped off. I feel cheated. I feel I've been conned! - Ken, Moline, Ill.

Ken: I receive many letters from teen car owners complaining that they must pay higher insurance rates. The concerns are that teen drivers have a poor safety record, thanks to inexperience and the "youthful exuberance" of some.

For insurance, according to information released from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 78 percent of fatal accidents involving teen drivers were due to driver error, compared to 63 percent among drivers age 20 through 49. And 31 percent of deaths when a teen was driving were caused by speeding, compared to 21 percent for older drivers.

These statistics show why insurance companies ask for an additional premium to insure younger drivers. The statistics are also the reason why parents get worried when their children ride with a teen driver.

Of course there are many, many safe, courteous teen drivers like you on the road. Only a relatively few are idiots behind the wheel, but they give all teens a bad reputation. A decade or two ago, it was only the guys who drove recklessly, but lately, I'm afraid, some of the girls have caught up with them!
