[0021] Why Does Everything Have to Be So Difficult?/Cheryl Lavin/20170416

Dear Cheryl: My wife and I dated during college. Three years later, in the midst of shopping for wedding rings, she said she needed time. I found out she was having a relationship with someone at work. After I caught her at his apartment, she emailed me a Dear John. Two weeks later, she called me sobbing and saying she wanted me back.

We're now married, and we have a large family, but she's never told me what happened with him. She denies having sex with him and gets angry when I ask her. She makes me feel like I'm the one who's at fault for bringing up the past. She says whatever happened before we got married doesn't really matter. I disagree.

Why do I need to know? Why am I still angry 15 years later? Why do I hurt? I know I need to move on, but I can't - Stuck

Dear Stuck: The problem isn't what your wife did or didn't do. The problem is that you're allowing it to make you miserable. Why? Why can't you allow yourself to be happy? Until you figure that out, you're not fully engaged in your life. You're cheating yourself, your wife and your children. 

Please see someone and figure out what's at the bottom of this.
