Dear Annie: I'm 25 years old, and I got out of a long-term relationship almost a year ago. Being thrust back into the world of singles was a difficult adjustment, and I'm still a little uneasy when it comes to dating. There seem to be a few schools of thought when it comes to dating advice for women. The one that most resonates with me - because I've seen it ring true in the past year and because the women (and men) who've told me this are intelligent, mature adults - is that if a man wants to see you, he will see you; and if he doesn't make plans, he's just not that into you. Doesn't matter if he's on a business trip across the country, busy with work or doing anything else. He will make it happen.

According to this logic, it would make sense to not make the first move and initiate conversation with a guy. That way, I'd know how into me he is. I'm a no-drama woman. Shyness is one thing, but I don't want to have to play games - play hard to get or whatever - after I meet someone to "test" his affections. What advice do you have for millennials in the dating world? Are there any deal breakers when it comes to communication or behavior on dates? - How to Be Single

Dear Single: There's no single rule, except to follow whatever guidance most resonates with you - and to never call multiple times in a row or send an avalanche of text messages. That said, if you like a guy and you want to ask him out or simply follow up after a date, why not? You're no doubt thinking about it anyway. If he's interested, great. If not, you will know and can resume kissing toads in search of your prince.
