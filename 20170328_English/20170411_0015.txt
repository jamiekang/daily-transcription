[0015] Long-Distance Relationship May Be Too Much to Overcome/Dear Abby/20170410
#0015/1070/213

Dear Abby: My boyfriend and I have been together off and on for more than two years. We have been in a long-distance relationship the entire time. I live in California, and he lives in the Midwest. I've been trying to get him out here because I have a job I love, and he could easily get a job in his sector our here.

His issue is that this area has "too many people and is too fast-paced" for him. I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to quit my job and move there. Finding a job there wouldn't be easy since construction is not booming as much. What do I do? Do I just give up my job, or keep trying to convince him to move? Or should I cut my losses and start over? -- Long-Distance Dating

Dear Long Distance: I don't think you give up a job you love in an environment you enjoy on the chance that this two-relationship might become permanent. If it goes nowhere, where does that leave you? It's time to ask yourself whether you really want to tie your future to someone who prefers a different way of life. Once you answer that question, you will know what to do.
