Dear Ann Landers: Our son and his wife adopted a beautiful little girl when she was 7 days old. The child will soon be 4 years of age, and they have not told her that she is adopted. We believe this is not right but hesitate to interfere. Anny suggestions? - Concerned Mom and Dad

Dear Mom and Dad: I don't mind interfering on your behalf. Tell your son the child should be told that she is special because she was "chosen." (And the sooner the better.)

Dear Ann Landers: I read the letter from "Married to the Monitor," who is bored with his wife because her interests are limited to family, church and career. His interests are reading and spending time on the computer.

This man spends five hours a day online and has the gall to criticize his wife for being boring? Give me a break. I don't think she should bother with marriage counseling. She ought to dump the cyber-creep and find someone who shares her values. - A Guy in Kentucky

Dear Kentucky: You are probably right, but she didn't write to me. He did.

Dear Ann Landers: The Japanese National Police Agency recently announced that in six months, it had recorded nine deaths and 1,627 injuries in car accidents where the drivers were talking on cell phones. I wonder whether that's how it is in the United States. - N.Y.C.

Dear N.Y.C.: Yakkers are the same worldwide. They can't possibly give full attention to driving when they're grabbing on the phone. I'd guess the accident rate is about the same in the United States.
