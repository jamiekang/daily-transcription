Dear Carolyn: I just got married to my girlfriend of 11 years (high school sweetheart). Over the past two or so years her sex drive has all but disappeared. Two weeks ago, I met a girl at a bar and slept with her that same night. I had no feelings for the girl, it was purely physical. It was a mistake in judgment and I feel awful and will never do it again (although it did feel great at the time). Should I consider telling my wife about it, or is it likely that telling will cause more problems than remaining silent?

Mistake: The good news is, there are worse things than having a adulterous fling with a chick you picked up in a bar. The bad new is, you're guilty of one of those, too. When you married your girlfriend despite having a massive, unresolved, possibly irreparable, long-standing and therefore totally foreseeable problem in your relationship, you made a much bigger mistake. That makes this much more than a to-tell-or-not-to-tell question.

As for the possibility a confession will cause bigger problems, um, you're already unhappy enough to be prowling and you're harboring two major lies (I'm counting the marriage as one). She, meanwhile, has lost her libido, be it to boredom, stress, sickness or sickness of you. Preserving the status quo doesn't strike me as a worthy goal to pursue. Besides, inertia is what got you into this marital mess. And even though the task of getting out of it got harder when you married and herculean when you cheated, the essence of it hasn't changed: Love you wife, take her hand and look the beast in the eye together - and this time, please, don't flinch.
