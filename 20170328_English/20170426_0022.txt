Dear Annie: My sister owns seven cats, three dogs, two turtles and a lizard. They are overrunning her house. There are random bits of garbage all over the floor, along with used dishes - both human and pet. When the dogs do their business in the house, she lets it stay there for hours while she gets other work done. The last time I was there, I wiped some food off of the wall, and she said I was being rude.

Two months ago, one of her dogs died. A week later, she bought a new one for $750. I happen to know she now has less than $100 in her bank account. And I worry she might lose her job. Her co-workers have complained that her clothing is sloppy and covered in dog hair.

I've told her many times that she has too many pets. She replies that it's not my business and storms off. I suggested she give me one of her dogs or cats, and she told me she would simply buy more. I believe her.

How can I make her see the light? - Concerned Sister

Dear Concerned: To some extent, your sister is right: This isn't your business. A messy home and dog-haired clothing may not be your preference, but they aren't necessarily a health risk. She is depleting her bank balance in order to purchase animals, but then, some people do that with shoes.

There can be a fine line between eccentric behavior that is within acceptable boundaries and behavior that indicates mental illness. We don't think your sister has crossed that line, but she bears watching. So stop criticizing her choices, but keep an eye on whether her appearance and the condition of her house substantially deteriorate, whether she goes into debt and whether the animals are well treated. And let her know you will be a sympathetic shoulder if she ever needs help managing.
